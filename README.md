## üìñ Reader

Reader is a simple self-hosted application that takes in a URL and converts it into reader-mode friendly content using the [postlight parser](https://github.com/postlight/parser). Reader includes an API to programmatically access reader mode content and makes a great content proxy for local LLMs and SearXNG.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

- üîó Supports any URL
- üé• Automatically convert some URLs to interactive embeds (YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, etc.)
- üòé Easy on both human and LLM eyes
- üîñ Bookmarklet for one-click sanization
- üîå API to programmatically access reader mode content
- üîå Plugin framework for oEmbed providers
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Light and üåô Dark themes

## Coming Soon

- üîç SearXNG plugin that redirects search results to Reader.
- üì∞ FreshRSS plugin that converts feed item bodies with reader mode versions of the items' URLs.
